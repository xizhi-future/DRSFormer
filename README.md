## Datasets

All datasets supporting this study are publicly available at [[huggingface]](https://huggingface.co/datasets/thuml/Time-Series-Library). These datasets should be placed in the `dataset` folder.

## Usage

1. Install Python 3.8. For convenience, execute the following command.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Prepare Data. You can obtain the well pre-processed datasets from [[Google Drive]](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13Cg1KYOlzM5C7K8gK8NfC-F3EYxkM3D2?usp=sharing) or [[Baidu Drive]](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1r3KhGd0Q9PJIUZdfEYoymg?pwd=i9iy), Then place the downloaded data in the folder`./dataset`. Here is a summary of supported datasets.

3. Train and evaluate model. We provide the experiment scripts for all benchmarks under the folder `./scripts/`. You can reproduce the experiment results as the following examples:

```
# long-term forecast
bash ./scripts/long_term_forecast/ETT_script/TimesNet_ETTh1.sh
# short-term forecast
bash ./scripts/short_term_forecast/TimesNet_M4.sh
# imputation
bash ./scripts/imputation/ETT_script/TimesNet_ETTh1.sh
# anomaly detection
bash ./scripts/anomaly_detection/PSM/TimesNet.sh
# classification
bash ./scripts/classification/TimesNet.sh
```

4. Develop your own model.

- Add the model file to the folder `./models`. You can follow the `./models/Transformer.py`.
- Include the newly added model in the `Exp_Basic.model_dict` of  `./exp/exp_basic.py`.
- Create the corresponding scripts under the folder `./scripts`.

Note: 

(1) About classification: Since we include all five tasks in a unified code base, the accuracy of each subtask may fluctuate but the average performance can be reproduced (even a bit better). We have provided the reproduced checkpoints [here](https://github.com/thuml/Time-Series-Library/issues/494).

(2) About anomaly detection: Some discussion about the adjustment strategy in anomaly detection can be found [here](https://github.com/thuml/Anomaly-Transformer/issues/14). The key point is that the adjustment strategy corresponds to an event-level metric.
